# Yamlld Linux
> [!NOTE]
> Yamlld will soon be deprecated for a much larger project
Yamlld is a busybox based Linux distro based on Yosild with many improvements to it, including UEFI/Legacy support, installation guide,
dpkg, newer kernel, new FS support, and many more things.

It's compatible with 32 and 64bit, and is very lightweight. 

## Building
Copy a prebuilt kernel into the same directory as Yamlld under the name ``bzImage``. Then, run sudo bash yamlld.sh.
